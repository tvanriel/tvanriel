I'm a software developer and I am passionate about my job and my code.  On my GitHub profile you will find what I have been writing recently.  I enjoy writing my code in [**Go**](https://github.com/topics/go), or in [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/topics/typescript) but I also know [**PHP**](https://github.com/topics/php), [**Python**](https://github.com/topics/python), [**C#**](https://github.com/topics/csharp), and [**Sass**](https://github.com/topics/sass).

I run some a few software projects for my friends, all of which I host on a [**Kubernetes**](https://github.com/topics/kubernetes) cluster.
