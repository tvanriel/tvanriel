I'm a software developer and I am passionate about my job and my code.  On my GitHub profile you will find what I have been writing recently.  I enjoy writing my code in [**Go**](https://github.com/topics/go), or in [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/topics/typescript) but I also know [**PHP**](https://github.com/topics/php), [**Python**](https://github.com/topics/python), [**C#**](https://github.com/topics/csharp), and [**Sass**](https://github.com/topics/sass).

----
I use [**Debian GNU/Linux**](https://github.com/topics/linux) as my main operating system because that's what I am most fluent at.  My first encounter with Linux was when I was about 15 years old and I still use it.

My preferred method of running production code is [**Docker**](https://github.com/topics/docker) containers, and I run a patched version of [**Pterodactyl**](https://pterodactyl.io/) on my servers to maintain them.

I also help my in-laws maintain their **Home-assistant** machine and their Windows NAS in my spare time.

Out of love for opensource and wanting to tinker with software, I try to run my home with as much open source software as possible.  My phone runs LineageOS, my desktop and laptop have Linux distributions installed on them, and my NAS runs FreeBSD with [**Nextcloud**](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).  

---
To stay fit I go running.  My record is 34:52 on the 10km.  Besides running I also practice [**Tang Soo Do**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Soo_Do).
